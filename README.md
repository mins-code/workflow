# Workflow Monorepo

This repository is a simple monorepo scaffold with two packages:

- `frontend` — a minimal Vite + React app skeleton
- `backend` — a minimal Express APIs

Usage

1. From the repo root install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Start frontend or backend separately:

```powershell
# start frontend dev server
npm run start:frontend

# start backend
npm run start:backend
```

You can also open each package and run its scripts directly.
